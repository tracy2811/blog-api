# Blog API

Blog API with basic CRUD functions allowing readers to view posts and post comment; and author to manage his published/unpublished post.

It is made when learning Web Development with [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)

Two basic frontends, one for the blog itself and one for author, to test this API:
